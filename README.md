Walmart Inventory Analysis Report
1. Introduction
As a junior business analyst at Walmart US, the primary goal of this research is to enhance inventory management efficiency. The focus is on two key issues:

Popular items frequently running out of stock, leading to lost sales opportunities.

Overstocking slow-moving items, increasing storage costs, and leading to markdown losses.

2. Findings
2.1 Top-Selling Products (Frequent Stockouts)
These products are in high demand and frequently run out of stock, leading to lost sales. They require careful monitoring to ensure constant availability.

Office Supplies: Paper (3463 units), Pens & Art Supplies (2723 units), Binders and Binder Accessories (2533 units), Storage & Organization (1904 units), Appliances (1187 units).

Technology: Computer Peripherals (2480 units), Telephones and Communication (2340 units).

Furniture: Office Furnishings (2264 units), Chairs & Chairmats (1205 units), Tables (944 units).

2.2 Slow-Moving Products (Overstock Issues)

2.3 Seasonal Demand Trends

3. Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are proposed to improve inventory management:

Increase Stock of High-Demand Products: To reduce stockouts and boost sales.

Implement Automated Restocking Alerts: For popular items to ensure continuous availability.

Reduce Stock Levels of Slow-Moving Items: Or adjust pricing policies to avoid overstocking.

Align Inventory Levels with Seasonal Demand Trends: To optimize storage and prevent markdown losses.

Use Data-Driven Demand Forecasting: To predict future sales trends accurately.

Visualization Dashboard
Your visualization dashboard should include charts that effectively communicate the key findings and recommendations. Hereâ€™s a summary of how to explain each chart:

Bar Chart of Top-Selling Products:

Show the high-demand products that frequently run out of stock.

Emphasize the need for careful monitoring and increased stock levels to avoid lost sales opportunities.
